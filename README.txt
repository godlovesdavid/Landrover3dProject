Perlin noise - geometrymaker.h : perlinNoise()
Bezier Patch  - SdlApp.cpp : drawBezier()
Lunar lander, ground, texture - SdlApp.cpp : SdlApp::draw
oversampling - glEnable(GL_MULTISAMPLE) - SdlApp()

NOTE: the perlin noise mountains may not draw on your computer (possibly incompatibility with gl function draws). Last time the fractals didn't draw on your computer, but it did on ours. So we got points back for the fractals. 
So if it doesn't draw, please let professor know so that ours can still be considered for being picked for extra credit. Thank you.
